# Autonomous Vehicle
This repository contains lab assignments completed for the Autonomous Vehicle course as part of my Master's program in Advanced Robotics at Centrale Nantes.

## Overview

The labs in this repository focus on various topics covered in the course, like Perception (Point Cloud), Mapping and Planning

## Contents

- `lab0/` -  Point cloud ground filtering, object filtering, clustering and bounding box estimation using Open3D
- `lab1/` - Cooperative Point Clould by merging perception from multiple Autonomous Vehicles Lidars 
- `lab2/` - Extraction of a map from OpenStreetMap and global planning with A* using OSMNX and local planning with DWA

## Visuals

Below are some key visuals from the lab assignments, including plots, diagrams, or screenshots to illustrate the results and methodologies.

## How to Use

This repository is for showcasing purposes. To explore the code and reports:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ioloizou/autonomous-vehicle.git
```

Feel free to browse through each lab folder to view the detailed documentation and code for each assignment. If you don't have the university VM you will not be able to run it as you will be missing many dependecies.
